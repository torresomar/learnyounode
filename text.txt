Seagulls in the sky, the wind blows by
Some of us run ahead, mountains on each side
With all of these words blaring above our heads
My dad prepared me with his spear and shield
(矛盾 in chinese literally means spear and shield, but it also means "contradiction". So I think Cheng saying she's come equipped with the spear and shield her dad gave her refers to her dad preparing her to combat the many contradictions you have to deal with throughout your life)
And so I can be brave. I won't be afraid.
